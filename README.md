# Effect-of-Overtime-Causal-Analytics

I analyzed the causal effect of working overtime on attrition for a sample of IBM employees. The results of
of my analysis is summarized below:

1. I observed that working overtime increases the propensity of an employee to attrite by 19.7%
2. Single employees have a higher propensity of attrition when worked overtime
3. Stock options are an effective strategy to check employee attrition for employees working
overtime
4. Mid-level employees have the lowest propensity to attrite when worked overtime
